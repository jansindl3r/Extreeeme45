# Extreeeme45
## A tool that adds extreme point under 45 degrees. default shortcut is *cmd+shift+e*. Constant angles across family help better interpolation. I recommend to use this tool in combination with 45 deg constrain. To activate it, tick the box in preferences/Glyph View saying *use shift 45 deg constrain*.
1. Empty selection counts as the whole glyph was selected
2. It rounds on-curve points that the extension added and ensures that its off-curve points are exactly 45 degrees when rounded to the grid.
3. It only modifies selected segments, rest of the data stays untouched.
4. It is prepared to support other angles in the future. Possibly also supporting step-checking of safe angles.
